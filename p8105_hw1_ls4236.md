## Problem 1

Load the `moderndive` library and `early_january_weather` dataset.

``` r
library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")
```

### Data Description

First of all, I try to write a brief description of the dataset using
inline R code.

``` r
head(early_january_weather)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 15
    ##   origin  year month   day  hour  temp  dewp humid wind_dir wind_speed wind_gust
    ##   <chr>  <int> <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>      <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 EWR     2013     1     1     1  39.0  26.1  59.4      270      10.4         NA
    ## 2 EWR     2013     1     1     2  39.0  27.0  61.6      250       8.06        NA
    ## 3 EWR     2013     1     1     3  39.0  28.0  64.4      240      11.5         NA
    ## 4 EWR     2013     1     1     4  39.9  28.0  62.2      250      12.7         NA
    ## 5 EWR     2013     1     1     5  39.0  28.0  64.4      260      12.7         NA
    ## 6 EWR     2013     1     1     6  37.9  28.0  67.2      240      11.5         NA
    ## # ℹ 4 more variables: precip <dbl>, pressure <dbl>, visib <dbl>,
    ## #   time_hour <dttm>

As the above table shows, in `early_january_weather` dataset, there are
358 rows (samples) and 15 columns (variables), including origin, year,
month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust,
precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. Specifically, key variables include:

- `origin`(`character`): the location of weather station.
- `year, month, day, hour`(`integer`): Time of recording.
- `temp` (`double`): air temperature in Fahrenheit.
- `humid` (`double`): relative humidity between 0 and 1.
- `wind_dir, wind_speed` (`double`): wind direction (in degrees) and
  speed(in mph).
- `time_hour` (`POSIXct`): Date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct
  date.

Notably, the `temp` column has an average temperature of 39.5821229.

### Plotting

Secondly, I try to create a scatterplot of `temp`(y) vs `time_hour`(x),
with color points using the `humid` variable.

``` r
plot_temp_th <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour,  y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "Time (hourly)", y = "Temperature", color = "Humidity")

plot_temp_th
```

![](p8105_hw1_ls4236_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("plot_temp_th.png", plot_temp_th, width = 8, height = 5)
```

Overall, the scatterplot shows that the temperature has increased over
time, rising from about 30°F in early January to around 50°F in
mid-January. Despite the upward trend, there has been frequent drastic
fluctuations in daily temperature. Humidity has also shown a generally
positive correlation with temperature, with higher values more common at
warmer temperatures in mid-January.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](p8105_hw1_ls4236_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
