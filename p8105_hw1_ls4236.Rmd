```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1


```{r data_loading}
library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
